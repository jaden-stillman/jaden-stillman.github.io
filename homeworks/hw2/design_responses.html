							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that white space is not only for an aethetically appealing experience. It is also used for organization, and enhacing focus on certain elements. I also learned that white space is used to create intuitive groups on a page.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the part that said one should not worry about putting too much white space in their website. I enjoyed how they discussed that the fear about users not wanting to scroll to the end of the page is not valid anymore with everyone used to scrolling on their phones and laptops. Overall, I liked this less is more approach.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Quote: Everyone has heard the saying “less is more”. This applies to content on any given page, where less visual noise makes for a better user experience. </p>
						</li>
