                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that flowing and smooth transitions help make an intuitive user interface. I also learned that lots of places for users to click or touch enhances ui. Lastly, I learned that the more lively and colorful one's ui, the more appealing it is. </p>

                            <p> My favorite part was looking at designs that were very organic. I specifically liked the Nike, and the cryptocurrency wallet one. I liked the flowing transitions and simplistic look.</p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I liked looking at the Nike shopping website user interface. I enjoyed how smooth the transitons are to different shoe colors. I also liked the smooth and organic transitions are when the shopping cart merged with the side of the screen. The interface acheived this playful design by having fun colors, smooth and organic transitions, and making sure every moving part was intuitive. </p>
